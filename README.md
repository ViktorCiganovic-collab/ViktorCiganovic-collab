👋 Hi, I’m Viktor Ciganovic
👀 I'm passionate about web development and programming. I love trying new things and pushing myself to grow. I believe learning is a life-long journey, and I am constantly challenging myself to expand my skills. My current focus is on back-end development and deepening my knowledge in this field.
🌱 Right now, I’m deepening my understanding of Entity Framework and continuing to develop my back-end skills.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will help me learn, develop, and contribute to the tech community.
📫 You can reach me via LinkedIn.
